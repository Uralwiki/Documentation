<p><span class="new-term">Protective Collar</span>, or simply Collar, consists of buying 1 lot of underlying security, buying a put option, and shorting a call option with a higher strike price. Both options have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. While it is not a requirement, both options are usually OTM. This strategy is the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/protective-put">protective put</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/covered-call">covered call</a>, which serves as a hedge against large losses with a lower cost, but limits the gain.</p>
